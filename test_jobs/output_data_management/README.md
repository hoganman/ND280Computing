title: DIRAC "OutputSandbox" README

Introduction
============

This example goes deeper into submitting jobs using dirac. A sample JDL file is provided, but this file is automatically generated by DIRAC.

Submission
==========

To submit the job, you use the python executable

```bash
./OutputSandbox.py > OutputSandbox.out
```

Job Status
==========

You can view the job status using

```bash
dirac-wms-job-status JID
````
where JID is the job ID in the .out file

Output
======

Once you have confirmed the job has completed, you can download the output data using DIRAC

```bash
[user@host ~]$ dirac-wms-job-get-output JID
Job output sandbox retrieved in /home/user/JID/
[user@host ~]$ ls JID
env.out
std.out
job.log
[user@host ~]$ wc -l JID/env.out
161 JID/env.out
```
