title: DIRAC "OutputSandbox" README

Introduction
============

This example goes deeper into submitting jobs using dirac. A sample JDL file is provided, but this file is automatically generated by DIRAC.

Submission
==========

To submit the job, you can either use the python executable (easy)

```bash
./OutputSandbox.py > OutputSandbox.out
```
or edit the jdl file with your specifics and use the following command (harder)

```bash
dirac-dms-job-submit -f Helloworld.jid sample_HelloWorld.jdl
```

Output
======

Depending on the route you took above, you can view the job status using

```bash
dirac-wms-job-status JID
````

where JID is the job ID in the JID file or .out file
