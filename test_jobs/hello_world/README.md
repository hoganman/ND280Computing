title: DIRAC "Hello World" README

Introduction
============

To submit jobs using dirac. A sample JDL file is provided, but this file is automatically generated by DIRAC at submission. To illustrate this, please follow this example

Submission
==========

To submit the job, you can either use the python executable (TESTED)

```bashe
./HelloWorld.py > HellWorld.out
```
or edit the jdl file with your user specifics and use the following command (NOT TESTED!)

```bash
dirac-dms-job-submit -f Helloworld.jid sample_HelloWorld.jdl
```

Job Status
==========

Depending on the route you took above, you can view the job status using

```bash
dirac-wms-job-status JID
````
where JID is the job ID in the JID file or .out file

Output
======

Once you have confirmed the job has completed, you can download the output data using DIRAC

```bash
[user@host ~]$ dirac-wms-job-get-output JID
Job output sandbox retrieved in /home/user/JID/
[user@host ~]$ ls JID/
std.out
job.log
```

To view the automatically generated JDL file, use the following command

```bash
dirac-wms-job-get-jdl JID
```
